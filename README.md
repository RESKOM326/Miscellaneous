# Miscellaneous
As the name says. You can find from mail log java filter to Minecraft server crash detector in C.

**INDEX**

*LogStatistics:* Contains a java program that filters a folder with mail log files. Generates in the same folder (will change so it generates to a chosen path) a plain text file with some statistics about the logs.
This was a friend's universitary project and asked me for help. The statistics were arbitrary chosen by the subject's teacher. (Information Processing in Telematic Applications).

*Minecraft Server Crash Detector:* Small C program supported with batch/bash scripts that detects if the running MC server (lauched in terminal mode) has crashed. If so, moves the crash log to a chosen folder and restarts the server automatically.
A program like this could easily be done using only OS scripts, but I was learning C and thought it would be nice to use this language to practice.
The idea came up when I hosted a server for my friends in my computer. It crashed many times due to usage of many heavy mods, and I was not available when so to restart the server. **WILL ADD SOON WITH BOTH WINDOWS AND LINUX VERSIONS**
